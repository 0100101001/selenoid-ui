== Contributing & Development

1) Ensure you have https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn[yarn] and https://github.com/rakyll/statik[statik] installed.

2) Generate static resources:

[source,bash]
----
$ go generate ./ui ./...
----

3) Build (requires Golang 1.11 and above):

[source,bash]
----
$ go build
----

4) To build Docker container type:

[source,bash]
----
$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build
$ docker build -t selenoid-ui:latest .
----

5) To run local development with hot reloads it's better to start Selenoid UI binary as `./selenoid-ui -allowed-origin="*"`
as well as `cd ui && yarn start`

NOTE: For some reason devserver can't proxy SSE properly and thus realtime updates can get stuck.
As a workaround you can change the path in the `Viewport` container from `/events` to `http://localhost:8080/events`,
but don't forget to ignore that change on commit!


=== Documentation

Locally can be generated with:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run --rm -v `pwd`/docs/:/documents/      \
    asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor                \
    asciidoctor -D /documents/output/ index.adoc
----
